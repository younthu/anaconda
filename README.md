# Anaconda Develop Environments

I have few machines, including a workstation with powerfull GPU.

But usually, i use laptops for daily work, not powerful, but easy to take along with me.

and, i am tired of connecting it using remote desktop.

I found the jupyter notebook server is a good way to leverage the powerful workstation, from laptops.
